1. Teams & Rosters

Each team has 53 total roster spots.

At least 46 players must be active on gameday.

Positional minimums per team:

QB: 2

RB: 3

WR: 5

TE: 2

OL: 8 (any mix of T, G, C)

DL: 7 (any mix of DT, DE, NT)

LB: 6

DB: 8 (any mix of CB, S)

Specialists: 1 Kicker, 1 Punter, 1 Long Snapper

If a team drops below these minimums, they must sign free agents to correct it before the next game.

2. Salary Cap

Salary cap is $255,000,000 per team (adjust this for season year).

A transaction (trade, signing, extension) is invalid if it pushes a team over the cap.

Each player has:

Contract years

Cap hit (annual salary applied to the cap)

Cap space = Salary Cap − Current Total Salaries.

Dead cap: If a player is cut, his cap hit for that year still counts.

Cap: $255,000,000 (adjust yearly).

Cap applies to active players, IR players, dead money from cuts.

Cap space = Salary Cap − Current Total Salaries.

3. Transactions
3.1 Trades

Trades can involve players and draft picks.

Trade checks before approval:

Cap compliance (neither team exceeds cap after trade).

Roster size (no team exceeds 53 players).

Trade balance is not enforced (teams can make lopsided trades).

Example trade format:

TRADE: Eagles send WR DeVonta Smith + 2026 3rd Rd Pick 
       to Bears for CB Jaylon Johnson.

3.2 Free Agency

Free agents are listed in free_agents.csv.

To sign a free agent:

Team must have open roster spots.

Team must have enough cap space.

If two teams target the same player in the same turn:

The team offering the highest salary gets the player.

If tied, the team with the worse record gets priority.

3.3 Waivers & Cuts

A cut player goes into waivers for 24 in-game hours.

Waiver priority = reverse standings order.

If unclaimed, player moves to free agents pool.

4. Contracts, Extensions & Restructures
4.1 Contracts

Each player has:

Contract length (years remaining).

Annual salary (cap hit).

Guaranteed money (cannot be avoided if cut).

Cutting a player before contract end creates dead cap, equal to remaining guaranteed salary.

4.2 Extensions

Teams may negotiate extensions for players in the final year of their contracts.

Extension rules:

New salary must be ≥ player’s current salary if the player is above-average (rating ≥ 75).

Extensions add 2–5 years typically.

Extended contracts replace the expiring one and begin the following season.

Extension signing bonuses (if modeled) can be spread over contract years to lower current-year cap hit.

4.3 Restructures

Teams may restructure contracts to free up cap space.

Rules:

A restructure may convert up to 50% of a player’s current salary into a signing bonus.

Signing bonus is prorated evenly across remaining contract years.

Restructures reduce current-year cap hit but increase future years’ cap hits.

Example:

Player has 2 years left at $20M/year.

Restructure converts $10M into bonus → Cap hit this year becomes $10M salary + $5M bonus = $15M.

Next year adds $5M bonus to salary cap hit.

4.4 Franchise Tag (Optional Rule)

Each offseason, teams may franchise tag one player with an expiring contract.

Franchise tag = average of top 5 salaries at the player’s position.

Player is under contract for 1 year, after which they can be extended, tagged again, or enter free agency.

5. Draft

Annual draft has 7 rounds (32 picks per round).

Draft order is based on the previous season standings (worst to best).

Draft picks are tradeable (up to 3 years ahead).

Rookie contracts are fixed:

Round 1: $5–10M cap hit depending on draft slot.

Round 2: $3–5M.

Rounds 3–7: $1–3M.

6. Injuries & IR

Injuries can occur randomly (or be simulated via simulationrules.txt).

Injured players can be placed on Injured Reserve (IR).

IR rules:

Player must miss at least 4 weeks.

Opening a roster spot does not remove their cap hit.

Teams may sign replacements while the player is on IR.

7. Season Structure

Regular Season: 17 games per team.

Playoffs: Top 7 teams per conference make playoffs.

Seed #1 in each conference gets a bye.

Standard playoff bracket format (Wild Card → Divisional → Conference Championship → Super Bowl).

8. Rule Enforcement

The LLM/game engine must:

Reject invalid trades/signings (cap or roster violations).

Ensure roster minimums are respected weekly.

Update all CSV files consistently after transactions.

9. Narrative/Events (Optional)

The game master may introduce special events:

Retirement

Holdouts (player demands new contract)

Surprise breakout (ratings boost)

Off-field issue (temporary suspension)

These events must not violate core rules (cap, roster size, etc.).

10. Owner/GM Decision Rules
10.1 Trade Limits

Max 3 trades per team during regular season.

Unlimited trades allowed in offseason.

10.2 Free Agency Limits

Max 2 signings per week during regular season.

Unlimited in offseason.

10.3 Restructure Limits

A player’s contract may only be restructured once per season.

A team may restructure a maximum of 3 contracts per season.

10.4 Franchise Tag Rules

Max 2 consecutive tags on the same player.

After that, player must either be extended or hit free agency.

10.5 Extensions

Extensions may only be offered once per player per offseason.

If rejected, the player enters free agency at contract end.

10.6 Injured Reserve

No more than 8 players may be placed on IR in a season.

Prevents abuse of IR for roster expansion.

10.7 Gameday Roster

Teams must designate 46 active players.

If a team fails to meet positional minimums, they automatically forfeit that game.

1. Game Outcome Calculation
1.1 Team Rating Formula

Each team gets an Overall Game Rating (OGR) for a matchup:

OGR = (Offense × 0.45) + (Defense × 0.45) + (Special Teams × 0.10)


Offense Rating (OR) = (QB_OVR × 0.35) + (OL_Avg_OVR × 0.20) + (WR1_OVR × 0.15) + (WR2_OVR × 0.10) + (RB1_OVR × 0.10) + (TE1_OVR × 0.10)

Defense Rating (DR) = (DL_Avg_OVR × 0.25) + (LB_Avg_OVR × 0.20) + (CB1_OVR × 0.15) + (CB2_OVR × 0.15) + (S1_OVR × 0.15) + (S2_OVR × 0.10)

Special Teams Rating (STR) = (K_OVR × 0.4) + (P_OVR × 0.3) + (KR/PR_SPD × 0.3)

Optional modifier: Home Field Advantage = +3 OGR.
Optional modifier: Coach Quality = ±2–5 OGR.

1.2 Win Probability
WP(Team A) = 50% + (OGR_A - OGR_B) × 1.5%
Clamp: 10% ≤ WP ≤ 90%

1.3 Random Upset Factor

Even if a team is heavily favored, underdog always has at least 10% chance to win.

Upsets should trigger narrative events (e.g., “QB throws 3 INTs,” “Defense scores late TD”).

2. Scoring Simulation
2.1 Base Scoring Range

NFL average = 22–24 points.

Expected score per team:

ExpectedPoints = (OGR / LeagueAvgOGR) × 22
FinalPoints = ExpectedPoints ± Rand(0,10)
Clamp: 7 ≤ FinalPoints ≤ 45

2.2 Stat Allocation

Passing Yards

PassYards = (QB_AWR / 100) × (QB_OVR / 100) × (TotalYards × 0.6) ± Rand(0,75)


Rushing Yards

RushYards = (RB_SPD × 0.3 + RB_STR × 0.2 + RB_AGI × 0.25 + RB_COD × 0.25) / 100 × (TotalYards × 0.4)


Receiving Yards

Distributed by OVR weighting:

WR1 = ~35% of pass yards

WR2 = ~25%

TE1 = ~15%

Other WRs/TEs = remainder

Defensive Stats

Sacks = (DL_STR + LB_STR + DL_AWR + LB_AWR) vs opponent OL_OVR.

INTs = Opponent QB_AWR penalty vs CB/S SPD + AWR.

Forced fumbles = STR-based chance (DL/LB vs RB).

Distribution rules:

Passing = 55–70% of total yards.

Rushing = 30–45%.

TDs allocated proportionally by yardage shares.

3. Season Simulation
3.1 Schedule

17 games per team (from schedule.csv).

Weekly injuries/fatigue may adjust ratings.

3.2 Standings

Wins rank teams.

Ties = 0.5 win + 0.5 loss.

Tiebreakers:

Head-to-head

Conference record

Strength of victory

4. Playoff Simulation
4.1 Wild Card Round

Top seed bye.

Same win probability formula as regular season.

4.2 Divisional + Championship Rounds

Home team gets +3 OGR.

4.3 Super Bowl

Neutral field (no home bonus).

Extra variance: ±14 points possible.

5. Injuries in Simulation

Injury Chance

InjuryChance = (100 - INJ) / 1000 per game


Example: INJ 95 → 0.05 chance; INJ 70 → 0.30 chance.

Severity

50% = 1–2 weeks

30% = 3–6 weeks

20% = season-ending (IR)

6. Player Progression/Regression

Players <25 with above-average stats → +1 to +3 OVR.

Players >30 → -1 to -3 OVR.

Injury-prone seasons reduce INJ permanently (by 1–3).

Breakout rookies may gain extra SPD/AGI/COD boost.

7. Narrative Events

Upsets, blowouts, and star performances trigger auto-generated narratives.
Examples:

“QB throws 4 TDs to lead comeback.”

“Defense forces 3 turnovers in upset win.”

“RB explodes for 150+ yards.”

“Star WR injured in 2nd quarter.”

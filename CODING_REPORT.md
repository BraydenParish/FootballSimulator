# Coding Report

## Completed
- Added week simulation support for quick vs detailed modes, including big-play logs persisted via new `game_events` table and richer GameBoxScore payloads.
- Enhanced `SimulationService` to generate highlight events, track injuries, and populate player stat metadata used by the frontend.
- Updated `/simulate-week` FastAPI endpoint to accept mode selection, store narratives, and surface summaries/play-by-play alongside persisted box scores.
- Introduced `BoxScoreService`, `/games/box-scores`, and `/games/{id}/box-score` endpoints for weekly summaries.
- Added depth chart endpoints (`GET/POST /teams/{id}/depth-chart`) and roster service helpers for slot validation.
- Implemented trade validation endpoint (`POST /trade/validate`) returning user-friendly results prior to execution.
- Added `NarrativeService`, `week_narratives` table, and `/narratives` endpoint for weekly storylines.

## Outstanding / Blockers
- Frontend (`leagueApi`, dashboard, depth chart UI, trade & free agency views) still expect legacy mock shapes; adapters must be updated to consume the new backend responses.
- Data ingestion from `/shared/data` files remains broken (ratings/depth charts HTML exports); loaders need parsing fixes before automated tests can pass.
- Team stats endpoint response shape not yet mapped into frontend display.

## Tests
- `python -m pytest tests/backend` *(fails: shared/data/ratings.txt contains extended characters and non-delimited content; loader currently expects pipe-delimited UTF-8 text, so load_data.main() raises UnicodeDecodeError before tests run.)*
